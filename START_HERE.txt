   - Delete the `static` folder

3. Set it to: `webapp`

## 📂 Correct File Structure in GitHub:

Your repository should show these files at the TOP LEVEL:
```
✅ app.py
✅ crawler.py
✅ requirements.txt
✅ Procfile
✅ runtime.txt
✅ static/
   └── index.html (39KB - MUST have content!)
✅ API_SETUP_GUIDE.md
✅ BEGINNER_GUIDE.md
✅ DEPLOY.md
✅ TROUBLESHOOTING.md
```

**NOT like this:**
```
❌ webapp/
   └── (all files inside)
```

Unless you set "Root Directory" to `webapp` in Render settings.
